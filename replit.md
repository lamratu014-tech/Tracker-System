# Ops & Planning — Programme Operations & Planning Platform

## Overview
Mobile Expo app (React Native) for organisations to manage a Stream → Team → Project → Milestone hierarchy plus a separate Events calendar. **Migrating from local-first to API-backed**: domain data (streams/teams/projects/milestones/events/members/team-notes) still lives in a Zustand global store persisted to AsyncStorage, but **auth/invites are server-backed** — login, invite creation, and invite acceptance go through the Express + PostgreSQL API in `artifacts/api-server`. Per-screen migration of the rest of the data layer is tracked in follow-up tasks.

API contract: `lib/api-spec/openapi.yaml` covers the Stream→Team→Project→Milestone hierarchy plus events/team-notes/members and the 3-role auth model. Run `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-spec run codegen` after editing the spec; generated zod schemas live in `lib/api-zod` and React Query hooks in `lib/api-client-react`. DB schema sources of truth: `lib/db/src/schema/*` (push with `pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push`).

## Architecture

### Stack
- **Runtime**: Expo SDK 54, expo-router v6, React Native 0.81
- **State**: Zustand global store with `persist` middleware (AsyncStorage); persist key `ops-planning-store-v2`
- **Auth**: Real password auth via `/api/auth/login` (server bcrypt + 30-day session token). Token stored in `expo-secure-store` (native) / `localStorage` (web). `lib/auth/AuthContext.tsx` is the source of truth for the signed-in user; AuthGate in `_layout.tsx` waits on it. Generated client base URL + bearer header are configured at module load via `setBaseUrl`/`setAuthTokenGetter`.
- **Fonts**: @expo-google-fonts/inter (400/500/600/700)
- **Icons**: @expo/vector-icons (Feather)

### Roles (3 login tiers + non-login members)
- **admin** — Full access across the whole programme
- **stream_overseer** — Full access to all teams within their assigned stream
- **leader** — Manage their own team only
- **(member)** — NOT a login role. Members are roster-only entries on a team (top-level `members[]`)

### Permission helpers (`store/useStore.ts`)
- `canManageEverything(user)` — admin only
- `canManageStream(user, streamId)` — admin OR stream_overseer of that stream
- `canManageTeam(user, teamId, streams)` — admin OR overseer of containing stream OR leader of that team
- `canCreateForTeam(user, teamId, streams)` — same as above; programme-wide creation requires admin
- React hooks: `useCurrentUser()`, `useCanManageStream(streamId)`, `useCanManageTeam(teamId)`

### Hierarchy
```
Streams → Teams → Projects → Milestones
Members are top-level, scoped to a team
Each Team has its own Notes timeline (TeamNote[] on Team)
Events are separate, optionally linked to a stream OR team
```

### Auth flow (server-backed)
1. **First admin** is created via `POST /api/auth/setup` (only allowed when the
   `users` table is empty AND `SETUP_SECRET` is set). Example:
   `curl -X POST "$REPLIT_DEV_DOMAIN/api/auth/setup" -H "content-type: application/json" -d "{\"email\":\"...\",\"name\":\"...\",\"password\":\"...\",\"setupSecret\":\"$SETUP_SECRET\"}"`
2. Admin (or in-scope stream overseer) invites a user via `/new-user` →
   server creates an **inactive** user row (no passwordHash, active=false)
   plus an invite row in a single transaction, and returns a 6-char code
   (Crockford-ish alphabet, no I/O/0/1). The "Invite created" screen
   displays the code with a Copy action.
3. Invitee opens `/accept-invite`, enters the code + a password (display
   name comes from the invite row) → server activates the pre-provisioned
   user (sets passwordHash, flips active=true), consumes the invite, and
   returns a session token; the mobile app immediately signs them in.
4. Subsequent logins use email + password at `/login`.
5. Reusing or mistyping a code surfaces a clear server-side error.

├── login.tsx                # Email + password login (calls /api/auth/login)
├── accept-invite.tsx        # 6-char code + password; name pulled from invite preview (calls /api/auth/accept-invite)
├── new-user.tsx             # Admin invite → calls /api/auth/invite, shows returned code

```

### Store actions
- Auth: `loginByEmail`, `loginById`, `logout`, `inviteUser`, `acceptInvite`, `clearLastInviteCode`
- CRUD: streams, teams, projects, milestones, events, users
- Members: `addMember`, `updateMember`, `deleteMember`
- Team notes: `addTeamNote(input, authorId)`, `updateTeamNote(id, body)`, `deleteTeamNote(id)` — leaders/overseers/admins can post; authors (or admins) can edit/delete
- `resetSeed()` — restores demo data

## User preferences
- Local-first, no backend dependency for the mobile app
- Real email login (no profile picker)
- Stream overseers must have full access across all teams in their stream
- Members are roster entries, not login accounts
